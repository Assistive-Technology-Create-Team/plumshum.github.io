# Navigating this Repository
This is where we organize the code for our project. This is a README file in the repository. It informs you what this repository is all out.
Repositories track the code and its history. Code can be managed and changed in different versions. To nagivate changes and different versions, Github uses a system of managing *branches* and utilizing *pulls and commits*

# Overall Process:
*For running machine learning*
1. Upload FallAllD2.csv and machine learning.ipynb to Google Colab
2. Run machine learning.ipynb to create the machine learning model. Right now models are already created so you don't need to do this step. 
4. Make sure you've collected data from the raspberry pi using sensordata.py
5. Run script.py (not modified yet) to test the model (models are in the folder all_models with the raspberry pi data.

# Files and Descriptions:
## FallAllD: 
  a folder that holds the raw data from FallAllD dataset. 
## all_models
  a folder that stores the models. there is *teacher* model and 5 *student* models
  do not edit this file! you can override (commit and merge) *only if you think the model has improved*
  link to the number and its sensors on this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TpSVM3uZE9tMWJ3GjHTN2FUoAuAVpbvETwpVx0u42gk/edit#gid=0)?
## Instructions.md
  instructions for setting up raspberry pi on vscode
## machine learning.ipynb
  it's where the machine learning does it job duh
  In different branches there are different models. Right now there are 3 models:
   1. Simple Neural Network Model
   2. LSTM Model with Kaggle Data
   3. LSTM Model (work in progress) with FallAllD data
## script.py
  using the saved model, it tests the model saved in lstm_model.h5 with raspberry pi data collected 
## sensordata.py
  where Accelerometer data is collected using raspberry pi's sensor and then saved into csv files. 
  time_intervals can be modified

# What is the MIT Create [Challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/beaver-works-assistive-tech/create-challenge/the-challenge)?

# Our Project
## Summary
Create an assistive piece of technology that can sense when a senior is in danger, and communicate the situation to emergency workers

## Major Components
There are three major components
1) Sensors that detect *falling* movement
2) A device that connects the sensor to a communicative application
3) The program

*to articulate: as of now we are planning to program either in Raspberry Pi + Typescript, or potentially Python*
