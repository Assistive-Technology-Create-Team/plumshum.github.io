# Navigating this Repository
This is where we organize the code for our project. This is a README file in the repository. It informs you what this repository is all out.
Repositories track the code and its history. Code can be managed and changed in different versions. To nagivate changes and different versions, Github uses a system of *branches* and *pull and push requests*



# What is the MIT Create [Challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/beaver-works-assistive-tech/create-challenge/the-challenge)?

# Our Project
## Summmary
Create an assistive piece of technology that can sense when a senior is in danger, and communicate the situation to emergency workers

## Major Components
There are three major components
1) Sensors that detect *falling* movement
2) A device that connects the sensor to a communicative application
3) The program
*to articulate: as of now we are planning to program either in Raspberry Pi + Typescript, or potentially Python*

## Sample Projects
