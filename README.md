# What is the MIT Create Team [Mission](https://sites.google.com/view/beaver-works-assistive-tech/create-challenge/the-challenge)?

# Our Project
## Summmary
Create an assistive piece of technology that can sense when a senior is in danger, and communicate the situation to emergency workers

## Major Components
There are three major components
1) Sensors that detect *falling* movement
2) A device that connects the sensor to a communicative application
3) The program

## Sample Projects
Please look at these sample projects to understand what we are doing:
