To-do Saturday:
  Set-Up raspberry pi with portable battery 
  Connect to VSCode (sensordata.py, script.py, and the model )
  Collect Data 
  Test out different Cases:
    Time each action (START to FINISH)

Fall Detect:
   RED Flashing Light, speaker go off
   15 second buffer time
   Home Assistance Contact
Malfunctioning sensors:
    Yellow solid light, text, and sound

Low Battery:
    Yellow Flashing light, text, and sound

Not enough data:
    Text 

When wifi disconnects or out of wifi range:
    Yellow solid light to show that the emergency contacts cannot be called, however the device still can detect falls and will have the alarm sound 

False alarm: 
    the device thinks the person fell but the person did not
    Off button for the alarm + 15 sec buffer time before contacting emergency contacts
If the sound is not loud enough:
We can test the sounds from the alarm to make sure that it is loud enough to hear from other rooms in the house

Getting the device wet:
     A future feature to the device could be a sealed case in order to prevent issues with splashing water
